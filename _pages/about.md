I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University](https://www.oist.jp/), where I work in the [Biodiversity and Biocomplexity Unit](https://arilab.unit.oist.jp/) supervised by Dr. Evan Economo.

I am a biologist interested in where organisms are found, why they are found there, and what the implications are of them being there. This research direction leads to many questions that are crucial to address in this age of accelerated environmental change. A few examples are: how ranges are predicted to shift in the future given climate change; how individual species and communities are affected by the environment and how these relationships may change over time; and how best to measure realistic range sizes for conservation threat assessments. My research aims to both advance science and inform on-the-ground efforts to directly address environmental problems.
